# landing-project
Creating my first entire web page based on the design provided. Image of completed project is saved in the images folder, along with an image of the fonts and colors to use. 

This website has four main sections and a footer. 

Step one, write all the boilerplate html. Add remaining html content needed for the page. (Commit to github early and often)

Step two, focus on adding css styling to each section. One at a time. (Commit to github early and often)
Many of the layout requirements for this project look similar to previous flexbox exercises. Look at those if you need a refresher.

Don't worry about making this web page adapt to a mobile device. That will be learned later. 

If you get stuck google for solutions or post a question on discord.
